# bedrock

## Motivation 
Getting started with Greenfield projects can be tricky.
There are lots of different ways to structure and start a project, and a blank canvas can be daunting. 

bedrock provides the basic skeleton for any C++ project to resolve this and provide a starting point 
from which you can build. 

## Structure 
bedrock offers the following project structure

CMakelists.txt
src/
inc/
tests/

Additionally, you can look at the different git branches to see how different projects can be built up. 

## Supported Projects

* Sandbox - a simple standalone C++ file which can be used for any small and simple programs
